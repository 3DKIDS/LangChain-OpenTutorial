    "`LangChain` provides optional caching layer for LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful for two reasons:\n",
    "- When requesting the same completions multiple times, it can **reduce the number of API calls** to the LLM provider and thus save costs.\n",
    "- By **reduing the number of API calls** to the LLM provider, it can **improve the running time of the application.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use gpt-3.5-turbo OpenAI API and utilize two kinds of cache, **InMemoryCache** and **SQLite Cache** .  \n",
    "At end of each section we will compare wall times between before and after caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, we will use local LLM served with VLLM.\n",
